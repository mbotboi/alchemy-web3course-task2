This repo is my submission for the second task for alchemy´s web3 dev course

Project was done with Hardhat. 
Test files were created to test my contracts

This is the link to the front end, that was based closely on Albert´s example. I have to level up my front-end skills significantly in order to be a fullstack dev.
